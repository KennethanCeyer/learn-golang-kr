When contributing to the Go issue tracker, please **do not** make comments like this:

Such comments do not help fix issues. In fact, they make it harder by cluttering the discussion. The project admins will delete such comments as a matter of procedure (please don't be offended if we delete yours).

Instead of commenting, you may [add a :+1: reaction](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/#reacting-to-ideas-in-issues-and-pull-requests) to the comment or issue.

Of course, **please do comment** if your "me too" comment includes information that might help resolve the issue. This includes reports like this:

> This issue also affects me on Windows 10 when running all.bat at revision c0ff33.

(Although there's no need to make such a comment if an identical comment already exists.)

Thanks!
