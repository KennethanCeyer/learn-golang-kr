_*_ Go 1.5 or above is recommended.

## Longterm support

Go aims to support the two most recent OpenBSD releases, because OpenBSD officially supports only the two most recent releases, and makes a best-effort attempt to maintain ABI support in consecutive releases.

## ulimits (` /etc/login.conf `)

Edit `/etc/login.conf` so that the staff class has the proper
settings. The following is a working example of the staff class:
```
staff:\
       :datasize-cur=infinity:\
       :datasize-max=infinity:\
       :datasize=infinity:\
       :openfiles-cur=4096:\
       :maxproc-max=512:\
       :maxproc-cur=512:\
       :ignorenologin:\
       :requirehome@:\
       :tc=default:
```

If the database file `/etc/login.conf.db` exists, you need to rebuild it with:
```
# cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf
```

Ensure that the user you intend to build Go with is in the `staff` login class:
```
# usermod -L staff your_username_here
```
