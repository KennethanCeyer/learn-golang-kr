# 최소 요구사항

## 운영체제 (OS)

### [Linux](Linux)

Kernel version 2.6.23 or later. [_This depends on architecture though, we need to have specific builder for this._] Linux/ARMv5 requires much newer kernels, at least v3.1 (for `__kuser_cmpxchg64`).

We don't support CentOS 5. The kernel is too old (2.6.18).

For little-endian MIPS64, kernel version [4.1 is known to fail, and 4.8 works](https://golang.org/issue/16848). 

If you are using tinyconfig (e.g. make tinyconfig) for embedded systems, you will also almost certainly enable printk in the kernel as well as a console; we will not include those generic options here. For Go, you must also enable CONFIG_FUTEX.

### [Windows](Windows)

Windows XP (w/ Service Pack 3) or higher. We also test Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2, and 2016, which are roughly Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.

### [macOS (née OS X, aka Darwin)](Darwin)

macOS Sierra 10.12 or higher requires Go 1.7.1 or above.
Go only supports OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or newer. We only have builders for 10.10, and 10.11 as of 2018-02-16.

### [OpenBSD](OpenBSD)

The current officially supported -stable versions only.

### [DragonFly BSD](DragonFly-BSD)

Generally only the latest release version only. We have a builder, but it's not the most stable of our ports.

### [FreeBSD](FreeBSD)

FreeBSD 10 or higher, but FreeBSD 12-CURRENT is [not supported](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22447).
We only run builders testing FreeBSD 10.3 and 11.1.

### [NetBSD](NetBSD)

There are known NetBSD bugs (including kernel crashes) up to the current NetBSD 7.1. There is a reported fix in NetBSD 7.1.1 but it's unverified as of 2017-07-10, as we're not running builders again yet.  See https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.9#known_issues and https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20852

### [Native Client](NativeClient)

pepper_39 or newer.

### [Solaris](Solaris)

illumos (former OpenSolaris 10) based distributions or Oracle Solaris 11+. 

## Architectures

### amd64

All 64-bit x86 processors.

### 386

See https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment

* GO386=387: run on any Pentium MMX or later processor.
* GO386=sse2: run on any processor with at least SSE2 (the default).

### arm

See https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment

* GOARM=5: use software floating point; when CPU doesn't have VFP co-processor
* GOARM=6: use VFPv1 only; default if cross compiling; usually ARM11 or better cores (VFPv2 or better is also supported)
* GOARM=7: use VFPv3; usually Cortex-A cores

### arm64

All ARMv8-A processors.

### ppc64 (big endian)

POWER5 and above.
Starting with Go 1.9, only POWER8 and above are supported.

### ppc64le (little endian)

POWER8 and above.

### mips64 (big endian)

MIPS III or higher. Builder is using MIPS64r2.

### mips64le (little endian)

MIPS III or higher in little endian mode. Builders are using Loongson 2E/2F.

### s390x

z196+

### mips (big endian) and mipsle (little endian)

MIPS32r1, with FPU or kernel FPU emulation
